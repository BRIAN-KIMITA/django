                  Checking your tire pressure is important
                  for your safety as well as overall maintenance.
                  If your car doesnâ€™t have a tire pressure sensor or TPMS,
                  invest a few bucks in a tire gauge and check your tire pressure regularly.
                  Having the right tire pressure helps to improve fuel efficiency and control regular tire wear.
                  Good tire pressure will also help you know if your vehicle is correctly aligned.
                  Don't forget to check the spare tire!
